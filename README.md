# CS-255 System Analysis and Design

We were given a scenario about designing a system for a company, DriverPass. DriverPass is to help students pass their drivers test. In this project I designed different diagrams to model a system for DriverPass that could help them run the company. I think given information about what was wanted I was able to find the basic necessities needed for the core of the system.
